      Although, you could also check out any of the Star Wars movies (like "Empire Strikes Back"!), or a movie called "Pirates of Silicon Valley". It is about the
      early days of computers when Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were just
      coming up. The movie shows a good slice of life and gives you a good
      idea of what it was like to be a hacker in those early days.
